NAME
    tsh, a tiny shell

SYNOPSIS
    tsh

DESCRIPTIONS
    This is project 1 for EECS-343 (Operating System), Northwestern University.
    This program implements a simple command line interpreter, behaving like
    common Unix shell (sh, csh, tcsh, etc) allowing to run backgound and
    foreground jobs, pipe output and redirect jobs' standard input or output.

SPECIAL DESIGN
    1. Alias Support
        Alias Support is implemented by bi-link list. Alias commands will be
        loaded from disk file when TSH starts. Operations on alias commands are
        fully implemented in memory. And alias list will be written to disk,
        when exit. In order to neatly process complex commands in alias, we
        change the Interpret() function, and make RunCmd() recursive.
    2. Pipe Support
        Pipe is interesting, which is used for information redirection. It's
        difficult to understand, but Dr. James Glenn gives out some examples.
        This program uses a for loop to implement Pipe Support, creating pipe,
        execv process and destroy pipe in each loop.
